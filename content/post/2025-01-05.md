Two additional courses (on modeling + inference) to be added in 2025.  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/minecr.bsky.social/post/3lecqllb3v22v)

{{&lt; iconify fa6-brands bluesky &gt;}}

**Travis Dawry** (@tdawry.bsky.social; 24/1/3; 2024-12-27): In February 2014 I signed up for @minecr.bsky.social's "Data Analysis and Statistical Inference" Coursera course. dplyr was just over one month old.

I've since gone back to school, earned an MS and have been, among other things, teaching #rstats for over 8 years.

**Ilya Kashnitsky** (@ikashnitsky.phd; 21/0/0; 2024-12-29): Today I accidentally came across a curious representation of the globe (not really a proper geo proj) called AuthaGraph

Of course I googled how to do it in #rstats

Of course there came a solution

Of course it was coming from one of the usual heroes

# knitr

**Yihui Xie** (@yihui.org; 3/0/0; 2025-08-18): With knitr/rmarkdown, you can also include other chunks in one chunk: bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkd... Unless I misread Knuth's paper when I was a graduate student, I think knitr had implemented what he mentioned.  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/yihui.org/post/3lwoqdt36v22h)

**Thomas Lumley** (@tslumley.bsky.social; 2/0/0; 2025-08-16): IIRC Yihui mentioned in his Ihaka Lecture that litedown did but knitr didn't because he hadn't realized it was easy  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/tslumley.bsky.social/post/3lwi7jp2zwk2m)

**Avilinha** (@avilinha.bsky.social; 2/2/0; 2025-08-16): litedown (from yihui) allows for modifying the order of execution of chunks [ yihui.org/litedown/#se... ]... i thought knitr also allowed, but I am probably mistaken...

**Crystal Lewis** (@cghlewis.bsky.social; 79/1/10; 2025-08-16): I often need to filter data in #rstats based on many variables. The dplyr::if_any() and dplyr::if_all() functions are really handy for this.

I explored how @posit.co {orbital} + dbt delivers "good enough" zero-infra MLOps for batch model scoring in database from python or #rstats models

**We Are R-Ladies** (@weare.rladies.org; 26/0/5; 2025-08-14): Running R code on your phone... that is definitely magic!!

webR also makes it super easy to create #rstats learning resources that students can work with using just a browser, no install drama needed.

**Robert (Bob) Kubinec** (@rmkubinec.bsky.social; 22/2/4; 2025-08-15): My Quarto #rstats tip for big/complex papers is to set up R scripts that do data processing/modeling & save plots/outputs as RDS files. The Quarto can then load the RDS file & make any modifications to the ggplot2 object before plotting. This avoids unwieldy long Quarto docs /w complex caching.

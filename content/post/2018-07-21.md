> **Sam Langton** (@sh_langton; 17/3): More tessellated map tests in R using IMD data for Birmingham. No easy solution to get a visually appealing and geographically accurate map... depends on the aim. Massive difference in processing time.

# knitr

> **Ben Marwick** (@benmarwick; 4/0): @rctatman Often there are so many #rstats pkgs used in a project it can be hard to decide which ones to cite (do we cite knitr, ggplot2? usually those are not appropriate), here's some handy advice on that: https://t.co/b8JgUmsFSF  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1020482192248483840)

Is there a knitr/rmarkdown/YAML option to annotate the language engine used for each chunk? Or just include the chunk options in the output somehow?

Something as "raw" as this would work:

\`\`\`{r} 
foo_R( )
\`\`\`
## R output
>
\`\`\`{python}
foo_Py( )
\`\`\`

> **Seth Axen** (@sdaxen; 0/0): It looks like the kind of workflow I'm thinking of is supported by R Markdown using knitr. Knitr also supports using Python to run chunks, and it natively uses pandoc (and pandoc-citeproc!) to generate outputs. Will give it a shot and report back. https://t.co/hE6NVlZmYL  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1020386769366233088)

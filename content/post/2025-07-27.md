**Maximilian Scholz** (@scholzmx.bsky.social; 4/1/1; 2025-07-24): Moving my website from blogdown to quarto. Then realizing, that all the custom stuff I was doing is starting to be a pain in quarto and finally moving to astro. Ugh.

**New-Cleckit Dominie** (@ncdominie.bsky.social; 3/2/0; 2025-07-23): What gets me: I want my notes to be accessible and I'd not even grudge the time if so much of it weren't spent wrangling half-finished tools. (Bookdown in particular has the user-friendliness of late-90s TeX, and about a tenth the functionality.)  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/ncdominie.bsky.social/post/3lun37d74zk2m)

**Kyle Walker** (@kylewalker.bsky.social; 26/2/6; 2025-07-18): The first commit for the #rstats {tigris} package was 10 (!) years ago, and the package is still going strong.

tigris gets geographic data from the US Census Bureau into R for you -- often in a single line of code.

As tigris turns 10, let's review what it can do:  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/kylewalker.bsky.social/post/3lub55petek2h)

**Kyle Walker** (@kylewalker.bsky.social; 20/0/2; 2025-07-19): In the latest version of the #rstats {mapgl} package you can export features from the draw control as GeoJSON.

The video shows how you can edit features, export your edits, then open up in QGIS!

**Michael Friendly** (@datavisfriendly.bsky.social; 12/1/2; 2025-07-20): I'm always interested in the thinking / process that led to a general approach to data analysis and graphics. 
* What were the initial ideas that led to tidy thinking?
* Pipes were well known outside of #Rstats; how did magrittr play into this?
* What lessons were learned from {plyr} üì¶?  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/datavisfriendly.bsky.social/post/3lueepsrwwc2o)

**Jarrett Byrnes** (@jebyrnes.bsky.social; 196/8/56; 2024-12-21): OK, here is a very rough draft of a tutorial for #Bayesian #SEM using #brms for #rstats. It needs work, polish, has a lot of questions in it, and I need to add a references section. But, I think a lot of folk will find this useful, so.... jebyrnes.github.io/bayesian_sem...

**Joe Chou** (@incidentalfindings.org; 81/2/10; 2024-12-21): As far as I‚Äôm concerned, #webr and #shinylive is indistinguishable from magic.

I can‚Äôt believe that since first installing #quarto-webr a few hours ago till now, I‚Äôve gotten a relatively complicated #shinyapp exported, deployed, and running serverless.

This is magic. #rstats  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/incidentalfindings.org/post/3ldtkhhwd3c2t)

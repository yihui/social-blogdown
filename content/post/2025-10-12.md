**Andrew Heiss** (@andrew.heiss.phd; 47/2/4; 2025-10-02): I once had data that had a date column that contanined a mix of values like 2015, 2015-09, and 2015-09-19 and I built some wild case_when() check based on the number of characters to then add the requiste number of "-01" parts to get them all to be ymd 😱 This would have fixed *everything* #rstats  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/andrew.heiss.phd/post/3m2a4jvmhfs2s)

**Kyle Walker** (@kylewalker.bsky.social; 40/2/11; 2025-10-03): R-Universe by @rOpenSci is an extremely useful project.

My latest R package, {pmtiles}, is not a good fit for CRAN as it bundles a pre-compiled Go library.

With R-Universe, I was able to get installable cross-platform binaries built in hours!

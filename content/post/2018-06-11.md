> **Peder M Isager** (@peder_isager; 4/1): Thank you @dsquintana for your excellent tweetorial on how to create, edit and publish a blog online via @rstudio. Took me a little longer than an hour, but that's on me. The blogdown package is really quite intuitive: https://t.co/cpNaXwvlke  [&#8618;](https://twitter.com/xieyihui/status/1005789496166768642)

**Christoph Molnar** (@christophmolnar.bsky.social; 16/2/1; 2025-03-07): Only waiting for the print proof, but if it looks good, I'll publish the third edition of Interpretable Machine Learning next week.

As always, it was more work than anticipated‚Äîespecially moving the entire book project from Bookdown to Quarto, which took a bit of effort.  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/christophmolnar.bsky.social/post/3ljrsad4nbm2l)

**Yihui Xie** (@yihui.org; 7/1/2; 2025-03-05): If this is only intended for the profiling purpose, I think the litedown solution is much simpler than the knitr hook:

1. litedown::reactor(time = TRUE); litedown::roam()  # navigate to vignettes/
2. Add 

\`\`\`{r}
litedown::timing_data()
\`\`\`

to the end of each Rmd file, and preview them.  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/yihui.org/post/3ljo4lvwulk2y)

**EconMaett** (@econmaett.bsky.social; 4/3/0; 2025-03-03): Quarto either runs on the knitr engine and uses reticulate under the hood or it runs on the jupyter engine with rpy2. It‚Äôs nice when you want to showcase how do do something with either one of the two languages in say a blog post.  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/econmaett.bsky.social/post/3ljgs2qqz4s24)

**Christoph Scheuch** (@christophscheuch.bsky.social; 2/1/0; 2025-03-03): Afaik if there are multiple languages in the same quarto doc, then knitr does all the work by invoking reticulate (Python) or JuliaCall (Julia) and collecting results afterwards. The reason is that there can only be one engine per document.  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/christophscheuch.bsky.social/post/3ljhb752mqk2m)

**Harald Kliems** (@haraldkliems.fosstodon.org.ap.brid.gy; 1/1/2; 2025-03-06): #knitr #RStats #RMarkdown question: I have an RMD document that knits together a bunch of child documents (`knitr::knit_child`) that all contain the same 2 images. The images get embedded into the html file, resulting in a huge file size.

**Miles McBain** (@milesmcbain.bsky.social; 1/1/0; 2025-03-05): Hi Nick! Not done this, but my first thought on making something from scratch would be to log time stamps using knitr chunk hooks.  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/milesmcbain.bsky.social/post/3ljluvuk2ys2h)

# litedown

**Nick Tierney** (@njtierney.bsky.social; 3/0/0; 2025-03-05): I've found this approach in rmarkdown: bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkd... - which seems like it will work - there's also this one within litedown (yihui.org/litedown/#se...). 

I think what I'd like overall is some kind of summary output of each document and timings for a given rmarkdown doc.  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/njtierney.bsky.social/post/3ljltalvdgk2x)

**Peter Dalgaard** (@pdalgd.bsky.social; 88/0/30; 2025-02-28):  R version 4.4.3 "Trophy Case" (source version) has been released. (You can find it in cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/, or wait for CRAN to be updated.) 

This coincides with as-close-as-we-can-get-to 25 years since the release of R 1.0.0.

**Giles** (@gdeejay.bsky.social; 28/3/3; 2025-03-02): I'm really enjoying being able to play around with #LLM models in #Rstats using the ellmer package.

**Heiner Salomon** (@heinersalomon.bsky.social; 27/0/5; 2025-03-01): Oh wow, this is amazing!!! This nifty feature automatically formats your R-code based on the #tidyverse styling guide (mostly).

Honestly, getting into #RStats from Stata at first was a bit cumbersome, but there is just more exciting and very cool development at the edges with R.  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/heinersalomon.bsky.social/post/3ljc3xvk2ic2p)

**** (@randvegan.bsky.social; 24/5/4; 2025-03-01): I'm amazed how simple #rstats stuff can completely amaze others

I was teaching python users R today and I was shocked that they were impressed the most with lm() and that you can do linear regression in 1-2 lines of code

We couldn't get beyond that in the training. Such an interesting experience.  [&#8618;](https://bsky.app/profile/randvegan.bsky.social/post/3ljbqinnrrk2j)
